## Project Plans && Explanations ##

## FIRST STEP ##
- was done by doing the bare minimum of css just so you could see how things work, mainly focused on implementing the main features of the applications


## SECOND STEP ##
- making the application presentable, styling it propertly and documenting it along the way so you can implement more complex features later
- focused on css and documentation for the third step


## THIRD STEP ##
- implement chat messages, do all the "to-do's" documented on the second step of the application to improve every component.
- implement the main feature of the application, the snapchat streak but for interactions such as liking, desliking, commenting etc.
- this is the biggest step, It's going to take time to implement all the to-do's, plus the chat and the main feature of the application 
- Showing information onChange without refreshing the page all the time



## FOURTH STEP ##
- Professionaly redisign the entire application, add the details when you like a post for example and the color of the button changes indicating that is already liked
- Keep improving the application, making less API calls, faster response times, learn more about caching, how can you make your backend better, scale the backend to take more API calls
- Implement the live function at the very end, is by far the most complex.


## TERMINOLIGY ##

- TO-DO: Things to improve, implement or fix on a given component/page
- DOING: Explaning what that piece of code is doing
- DOCS: Every page that was documented has this word init, usefull to keep track of what you have done so far
